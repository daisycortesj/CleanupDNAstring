"""In this program, read a protein sequence and print out the following info:
 number of amino acids, total molecular weight, molar extinction coefficient,
 and mass extinction coefficient, theoretical eclectic point (pl) and
  amino acid composition"""

## aaCount(): return a single integer count of valid amino acid characters found

## aaComposition: return a dictionary keyed by a single letter amino acid code
## and having associated values that are the counts of those amino acids in the sequence

##molecular weight: calculates the molecular weight of the protein sequence
## calculation done by summing the weights of the individual amino acids and excluding
## the waters that are released with peptide bond formation
